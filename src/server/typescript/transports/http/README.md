# HTTP transport for deno

Deno uses the Fetch API in its runtime. 
There are other options, but to start with our examples will use this.
They also do that thing where they have two sets of docs, and who knows which one is up to date.
The base resolver example uses this set of docs as reference: https://deno.land/api@v1.42.4?s=Deno.serve.
